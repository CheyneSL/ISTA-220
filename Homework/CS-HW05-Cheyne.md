1. The *compound assignment operator* is a way to combine an arithmentic operator with the assignment operator IOT shorthand an expression.

2. The *compound assignment operators* are: **\*=, /=, %=, +=, -=, --, ++**

3. Two ways to *increment* a numberic variable by 5 are: **i += 5 / i = i + 5** Two ways to *decrement* a variable by 5 are: **int i -= 5- // i = i - 50**

4. A *while loop* runs until the *sentinel value* returns false.

5. An *iteration variable* is used to update the *control value* so the loop termiates at a certain condition.

6. If you don't change the loop variable in the body of a *while loop* block, the loop runs forever. 

7. A *loop statement* contains 3 parts: **initialization, boolean, control variable**. Any part can be omitted, but not all otherwise it will not compile.

8. A *do while loop* runs at least once as it evaluates the expression at the end of the block.

9. A *break statement* terminates execution in its current block of code and gives control to the next process or function to follow.

10. A *continue statement* forces the next iteration of the loop after the boolean expression is evaluated.

11. *Infinite loops* may be helpful if your application needs to continually 'listen' for user input.
