1. *Classes* are mechcanisms for *modeling* entities. They arrange information and behavior.

2. The two purposes of *encapsulation* are to support classification by combining *methods and data* within a class, and to control the *accessibility*of the *methods and data*.

3. You *instantiate* an *instance* of a *class* with the *new* keyword. You access that instance via the *object* name.

4. The default access is *private* for class fields and methods. You change them with the *access modifier keywords*.

5. You write a *constructor* by *declaring* a method with an *identical name* to the class with the access modifier, having NO return type, and have zero or more parameters.

6. *Class members* and *instance members* are different because you can modify the *types and functions* of *class members*, and *ONLY the data* for *instance members*. You create class members when you create the class.

7. You bring a *static class* into scope with a *using directive* and specifying *static* before the namespace and class name.

8. An *anonymous class* is useful for run-time declaration and instantiation with there are ambiguities.

9. *Polymorphism* is the ability to be used in more than one way.

10. A *message process* is the delegation of a process from separate entities.

11. The first object-oriented programming language is *Simula*, created in *1967*.

12. *Alexander Stephanov* was the *primary designer and implementer* of the *C++ Standard Template Library*. In my opinion, he wanted a more abstract language that focused on processes and relations more than segmentation.
