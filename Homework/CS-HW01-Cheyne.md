1. A *console application* is an application that takes input and displays output on the command line.

2. The difference between the *.NET Framework* and *.NET Core* is that *.NET Framework* targets *WindowsOS* specifically, whereas *.NET Core* targets *WindowsOS*, *LinuxOS*, and *MacOS*.

3. The *Main()* method in a console application specifies the entry point of an executable application.

4. Describe the files: *TextHello.sln* is the solution file and structures all files that make up your program. *TextHello.csproj* is the C# project file that contains a list of all the files to be compiled as part of your project. *AssemblyInfo.cs* contains information about your assembly like *name*, *description*, *version*, etc.

5. The purpose of a *namespace* is to separate C# files to based on file names, in order to prevent name clashes.

6. A *using* statement is a directive and brings a namespace/namespace data into the scope of your working namespace.

7. The entry point for a console app is *Main() method*. The entry point for a UWP app is *AppxManifest.xml*.

8. An *assembly* is the compiled output of your code as a *DLL/Dynamic Link Library*, or *EXE/Executable*.

9. There are 19 different implementations of *WriteLine()* method in the *Console* class.

10. The relationship between an *assembly* and a *namespace* is an *assembly* contains all of the *namespaces* that are present in the *DLL* or *executable* file.

11. A *graphical app* is an application that has a graphical user interface, opposite of a *console app*.

12. *Build* in *Visual Studio* compiles all of the assembly files and outputs a *DLL* or *executable* file.

13. *Bytecode* is an instruction set to translate source code into machine code. *CIL/Common Intermediate Language* is Microsoft's version of *Bytecode*. *CIL* is the language that the *JIT/Just-In-Time Compiler* uses to translate source code into machine code.

14. *Debug* in *Visual Studio* allows you to observe the run-time behavior of your program and identify problems.
